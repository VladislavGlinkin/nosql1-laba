Scala lets you write less to do more. As a high-level language, its modern features increase productivity and lead to more readable code. With Scala, you can combine both functional and object-oriented programming styles to help structure programs. 
Scala is well suited to building fast, concurrent, and distributed systems with its JVM, JavaScript and Native runtimes. Scala prioritises interoperability, giving easy access to many ecosystems of industry-proven libraries. 
Scala's static types help you to build safe systems by default. Smart built-in checks and actionable error messages, combined with thread-safe data structures and collections, prevent many tricky bugs before the program first runs.
